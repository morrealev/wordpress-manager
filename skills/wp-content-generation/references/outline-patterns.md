## Outline Best Practices

1. **Keyword placement:** Primary keyword in H1, secondary in 1-2 H2s
2. **Section balance:** Each H2 section should be 150-300 words (not too short, not too long)
3. **Internal links:** Plan 2-3 links during outline phase, not after
4. **Schema alignment:** Choose the outline pattern that matches the target schema type
5. **Reader flow:** Each section should lead naturally to the next
6. **Standalone value:** Each H2 section should make sense if read in isolation (for featured snippets)
