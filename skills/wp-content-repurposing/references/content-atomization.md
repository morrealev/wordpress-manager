# Content Atomization

## Overview

Content atomization is the process of breaking down pillar content (long-form blog posts, guides, product pages) into standalone atomic units that each deliver value independently. One pillar post can yield 5-15 atomic pieces for distribution across multiple channels.

## Atomization Workflow

```
1. SELECT source content (pillar post)
       |
2. IDENTIFY atomic elements (quotes, stats, tips, questions)
       |
3. EXTRACT and format each atom
       |
4. ASSIGN to channels (social, email, ad copy)
       |
5. SCHEDULE via content calendar
       |
6. DISTRIBUTE and track performance
```

### Step 1: Select Source Content

Prioritize content that is:
- **Evergreen**: valuable regardless of timing
- **Data-rich**: contains statistics, quotes, or unique insights
- **Popular**: already proven with traffic or engagement
- **Long-form**: 1,000+ words with multiple sections

Use `list_content` with `orderby: "date"` or traffic data to identify top candidates.

### Step 2: Identify Atomic Elements

| Element Type | What to Look For | Output Count |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Key quotes | Standalone insightful sentences | 2-4 per post |
| Statistics | Numbers, percentages, data points | 1-3 per post |
| Tips/How-tos | Actionable advice steps | 3-5 per post |
| Questions | Thought-provoking questions | 1-2 per post |
| Lists | Numbered or bulleted lists | 1-2 per post |
| Definitions | Explained concepts or terms | 1-2 per post |

### Step 3: Extract and Format

For each atom, create a self-contained piece:

```
ATOM CARD:
- Source: [post title + URL]
- Type: [quote / stat / tip / question]
- Content: [the atomic content, 1-3 sentences]
- Channel: [Twitter / LinkedIn / Instagram / Email / Ad]
- Visual needed: [yes/no, description if yes]
- CTA: [link back to full post]
```

### Step 4: Assign to Channels

Map atom types to their best channels:

| Atom Type | Best Channels | Format |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| Quote | Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn | Image with text overlay or plain text |
| Statistic | Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook | Data visualization or bold text |
| Tip | All channels | Step-by-step or bullet list |
| Question | Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook | Engagement post |
| List | Instagram carousel, LinkedIn | Multi-slide or numbered |

## Repurposing Matrix

One blog post (1,500+ words) can produce:

| Output | Count | Channel |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Twitter/X thread | 1 | Twitter |
| Individual tweets | 3-5 | Twitter |
| LinkedIn post | 1-2 | LinkedIn |
| Instagram carousel | 1 | Instagram |
| Facebook post | 1 | Facebook |
| Email digest section | 1 | Newsletter |
| Pull quotes for ads | 2-3 | Paid social |
| **Total outputs** | **10-15** | — |

## Content Calendar Integration

### Weekly Schedule from One Post

| Day | Content | Channel | Atom Type |
|-----|---------|---------|-----------|
| Mon | Full thread | Twitter | All key points |
| Tue | Article summary | LinkedIn | Overview |
| Wed | Carousel | Instagram | Visual takeaways |
| Thu | Engagement post | Facebook | Question |
| Fri | Individual quote | Twitter | Best quote |
| Sat | — | — | Rest day |
| Sun | Email digest | Newsletter | Summary + CTA |

### Monthly Cadence

- **Week 1**: Publish pillar post + immediate social promotion
- **Week 2**: Atomized social content from Week 1 post
- **Week 3**: Publish new pillar post + atomize Week 1 remainder
- **Week 4**: Cross-promote best performers + email roundup

## Quality Gates

Each atomic piece must pass these checks:

1. **Standalone value**: Does it make sense without the source article?
2. **Single idea**: Does it convey exactly one concept?
3. **Actionable or insightful**: Does it teach, inspire, or provoke thought?
4. **Channel-appropriate**: Does it fit the platform's format and audience?
5. **Brand-consistent**: Does it match the brand voice and visual style?
6. **Attribution**: Does it link back to the source when appropriate?

If an atom fails any gate, revise or discard it.
